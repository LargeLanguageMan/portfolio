# üîí Privacy First: Leveraging Local RAG Models for Confidential Document Securityi

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model is a powerful process that combines a large language model with your own data. This could be anything from chat conversations, database tables, PDF documents, and more.

In my experience, many organisations are keen to use the power of AI to streamline operations and improve efficiency. However, there's often a hesitation about sending sensitive information to external companies for storage or training purposes.

This is where local RAG models come into play. By keeping everything in-house, you can maintain control over your critical business data, which is often tucked away in offline documents like PDFs.

Setting up a local RAG pipeline for your business is worth considering. Whether it's something as simple as running it on a laptop for individual use or setting it up on a local server decked out with a few GPUs.

If you're keen on exploring the code, it‚Äôs all open-source and available on my GitHub.
